            <p class="lead">Version control systems make it easy for individuals or groups of people working on a project to easily manage all of the files involved.  It lets users keep track of all of the different versions of a file or files as they work on them.   It stores all versions of the files into a repository which can then be accessed by others.  The repository tells you who edited a file, when it was edited, and what was changed.  If a mistake is made, the file can then be reverted back to its original state.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local Version Control Systems store all of the files on the individual user's computer.  It allows them to keep track of the changes made to files using a Version Control System tool known as rcs.  The rcs command works on most computers and keeps the files organized to reduce the chance of errors when saving.  Without using rcs, users must save changes in new directors which can quickly get confusing and produce errors if the user fails to keep track of everything.  Rcs allows users to re-create what a file looked like at any previous time.  One downfall of Local Version Control Systems, however, is that it is not easily to collaborate with others.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working in large groups on a file or set of files for a project, Centralized Version Control Systems are very useful.  They store the repository for files onto a server, which can then be accessed by other users.  Everything is stored in a central place and files are checked out and back in by different users.  They also let administrators control who has access to certain files.  A downfall of Central Version Control Systems occurs when the server goes down, as no one will be able to check files in or out until it is fixed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In a Distributed Version Control System, such a Git that we used in class, you get the best of both worlds.  A repository is stored on all computer involved, as well as a centralized server.  This way if the server were to go down, there are back-ups of everything available and it makes the situation much less of a hassle.  It makes it easy to collaborate with group members and provides ways of doing so that are not possible using other types of version control systems. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Distributed Version Control System that was created in 2005 by the Linux development community when the commercial company that created BitKeeper began to charge for their tool.  Since this Version Control System would no longer be able to be used for free, people created a new one.  Since then, Git has come a long way and is now a very fast and easy to use Version Control System.  It is very useful and efficient when working with large groups and has an impressive branching system.</p>
